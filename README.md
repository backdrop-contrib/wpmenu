WordPress Menu
=============

What is WordPress Menu
-----------------------------
This is a Drupal/Backdrop module for replacing existing toolbar / admin_toolbar menu modules with a much more styled and usable interface, which WordPress uses. This module contains initial navigation links, as well as utilizes standard Drupal/Backdrop hooks to preprocess the data to anything you need.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------
The modules is hosted on Drupal.org as well as Backdrop CMS' GitHub repository, make sure you are downloading/installing the correct version.

NOTE: This module will conflict visually with any other modules adding a toolbar/menu to the top of the page, it is recommended to uninstall those types of module.

After downloading and unzipping, or installing via drush you will need to go download the appropriate WordPress JavaScript and CSS files from WordPress.org/download, I would recommend using [aaronott's script](https://www.drupal.org/node/2566407) to vastly simplify this process. I'll add that in to the repo at some point.
